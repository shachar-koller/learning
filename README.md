# Learning Java: Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is a personal sandbox for practicing **Java programming**, with a focus on implementing **common data structures** and **algorithms** from scratch.  
The goal is to strengthen core computer science fundamentals while getting hands-on experience writing clean, efficient, and well-structured Java code.


## 📂 Repository Structure

- `data_structures/` – Implementations of fundamental data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash maps).  
- `sorting_and_searching/` – Implementations of sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).  
- `timeComplexity/` – Examples exploring algorithmic complexity (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega).
- `parallelization/` –
- `graph_theory` - 


## 🛠️ Goals

- Practice **coding fluency** in Java.  
- Build a solid foundation in **data structures and algorithms**.  
- Write implementations that are **readable, efficient, and well-documented**.  
- Develop intuition for **time and space complexity trade-offs**.  


## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add **unit tests** for each data structure and algorithm.  
- Compare **different implementations** of the same algorithm, and visualize the differences
